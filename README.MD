A small battery-powered device that detects water leakage and sends an SMS alert.  
&nbsp;

## Features
- Completely `off` until water *(or anything conductive)* closes the circuit between two of its legs,  
thereby latching on the "soft latching power circuit".  
Which can later be turned off again by the microcontroller.

- Latches `on` by either water detection or by pressing the test button.

- Sends an SMS alert if water is detected.

- Sends SMS diagnostics if the test button is pressed.

- Built with an ESP32 and PlatformIO, in C++.
